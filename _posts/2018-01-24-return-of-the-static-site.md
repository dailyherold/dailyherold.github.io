## Writing is tough

Four years ago, I started this website as a way to play with some new tech, and motivate me to write more. Looking at my post history, it is pretty clear I only achieved one of those goals! I had grand visions of a thriving tech blog, with regular content derived from my day job as a software engineer, and night job as a curious nerd on the full stack journey.

Following an internal retrospective, I determined that instead of the vision alone, I needed to develop a _habit_ of writing. I was motivated by Levi Lusko's [recent sermon](http://freshlife.church/messages/message.php?id=814) on finding victory through the repetition of small things continually. He mentioned the book [Mini Habits](http://a.co/f5eXEmZ), and the power of creating small measurable habits instead of large "fuzzy" ones like, "eat healthier", or "write more." The message resonated with me, and I am determined to create a mini habit out of this blog:

> Publish one blog post per month

Still a challenge based on my track record, but small enough that I _think_ it is easy. The barrier to initiate is low. I'm not shooting for one blog post a day, or week, or bi-weekly, I'm going 28--31 days to come up with _something_. What about length? If shorter than a [seven minute read](https://medium.com/data-lab/the-optimal-post-is-7-minutes-74b9f41509b), no worries, the point is developing a habit.

Knowing me, I'll crank out some posts the first month, hit a nice multi-month streak off the bat, then stagnate. If I _do_ miss one month though, instead of dwelling on the snapped streak, I'll start prepping for the next month and counter back.

Stay tuned for the technical side on what I did to get the site updated and dressed in a snazzy new [theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).
