My name is John Paul Herold. I have a passion for Jesus, nerdin' out, Liverpool, design, architecture, and the ocean. Rather eclectic, but in some way or another grounded in my belif in form + function. I will be using this static'ly awesome space (that is hosted for [free](https://pages.github.com/)) to share some of the problems I solve and topics I am passionate about.
